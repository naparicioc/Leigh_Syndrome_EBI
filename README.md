# Leigh Syndrome EBI Project

## Introduction

Leigh syndrome is a rare hereditary neurological condition that primarily affects infants aged 3 to 12 months, although it can also occur in teenagers and adults [1]. Symptoms include difficulty with sucking, loss of head control, loss of appetite, vomiting, irritability, persistent crying, and seizures. Over time, patients develop weakness, lack of muscle tone, spasticity, coordination difficulties, developmental delay, ocular disorders, and feeding difficulties [1].

Leigh syndrome involves mutations (point mutations such as substitutions, insertions, or deletions) in different genes at the level of nuclear DNA (nDNA) or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2]. Generally, most affected genes are involved in energy production processes within the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation. This process consists of five protein complexes: complex I, complex II, complex III, complex IV, and complex V. Accordingly, different mutations in Leigh syndrome can affect the proteins of these complexes, reducing or eliminating the activity of each protein set. Therefore, identifying the mutation and diagnosing the syndrome is critical for establishing clinical intervention.

The use of bioinformatics for the study of orphan diseases has gained importance in recent years, mainly due to the absence of identification of patterns or point mutations that can be categorized as responsible for the disease [3]. Computational tools are crucial for analyzing large sets of genetic and molecular data, facilitating the detection of mutations and genetic variants associated with the disease [4]. Additionally, this discipline helps identify potential therapeutic targets and develop more effective treatments through the analysis of DNA sequences and the identification of genes involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. This work aims to determine the impact of various mutations associated with Leigh syndrome on gene expression, protein function, and interactions, as well as metabolic pathways, to propose future research directions for therapeutic development from a bioinformatic approach.
